<h1><b>Problem Title:- <em>Personalized Healthcare Recommendation System</em></b></h1>

We are a team of 4 members, we choose the topic Personalized Healthcare Recommendation System,
where we created an website with AI-driven healthcare recommendation system that analyzes individual health data, preferences, and genetic information to provide personalized treatment plans, preventive care suggestions, and lifestyle recommendations for improved health outcomes using only html and css.

The website  contains 5 elements. Each one is linked to a seperate web page.
First one is the About section where we have mentioned what our website is all about. Our vision and our goals.

Second one is the "our client" section where we have mentioned the reviews of the customer who has used our website and their views about our services.

Third is the 1 on 1 section where our AI comes into picture. This will ask you about your problems and symptoms and your habits. The users are requested to respond honestly 
to get more accurate solutions.

Fourth one is the "our account" section where the user's dashboard pops up. Note that this field is only available when the user has registered previously. This section will provide a completed dashboard about the suggestions. Our personal health chart. There will be our own personal "Lia AI" who will ask about your symptoms on a regular basis. On the basis of this you will be provided with personalised healthcare routines from time to time. The section will also contain lifestyle recommendations for suitable lifestyle. All of this data will be available in the dashboard.

And the fifth section is the login section where we have used javascript to ensure the email is not some junk. And also proper code is written to ensure that the passwords are correct.

We do agree that we haven't covered all the features in our prototype as of now. But we will keep adding elements to it as we continue working on our project. 
And we will keep updating our repository.
